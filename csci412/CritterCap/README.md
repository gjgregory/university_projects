## CritterCap

A silly Android app I made purely for educational purposes. It provides the user with a simple interface for taking pictures of animals (or whatever else) they discover and saving them, along with some details about the animal. They may also view all of their discoveries in a gallery of sorts. The app uses a SQLite database to store/pull all information. The app was made using Android Studio.
