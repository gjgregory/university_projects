This is a very modern process monitor for linux-based systems. It displays a TreeView containing a
ListStore of rows containing the name, owner name, %CPU, PID, and memory usage of each running process.
To anyone reading through this code, I aplogize for the grotesque lengthiness of updateStore().

**Makefile is included. Type 'make' to generate executable.
