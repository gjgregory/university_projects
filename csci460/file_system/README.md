## File System API

The task was to implement two CPU scheduling algorithms, which are simplified versions of those used in the FreeBSD and the ULE scheduler, then compare their performance with a simulation. The Makefile and some source files have been excluded, as I don't want to publish my professor's source code.

* FileSys.c - Implements functions declared in FileSysAPI.h that are used by the provided tests in order to simulate a file system.

Usage:

```
./APITest
./EasyTest
./DriverTest
```
