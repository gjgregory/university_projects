## CPU Scheduling

The task was to implement two CPU scheduling algorithms, which are simplified versions of those used in the FreeBSD and the ULE scheduler, then compare their performance with a simulation. The Makefile and some source files have been excluded, as I don't want to publish my professor's source code.

* sched_4bsd.c - Simplified version of FreeBSD.

* sched_ule.c - Simplified version of ULE scheduler.

Usage:

```
./sched_4bsd
./sched_ule
```
