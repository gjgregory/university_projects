## CPU Scheduling

The task was to implement two CPU scheduling algorithms, which are simplified versions of those used in the FreeBSD and the ULE scheduler, then compare their performance with a simulation.

* prog3_observer - displays information about the game hosted by prog3_server

* prog3_participant - used to join/play the game hosted by prog3_server

Usage:

```
make clean
make all
./sched_4bsd
./sched_ule
```
