## Multi-Threaded Radix Sort

The task was to implement a multi-threaded version of a famous algorithm. I chose one of my favorite algorithms, Radix Sort. Ultimately, the result was a failure as my multi-threaded implementation was significantly slower than the singly-threaded version. At least it was a fun learning experience.

* threadedRadix.py

Usage:
```
$ python2 threadedRadix.py
```
